# Economies of Scale

Dedicated to the devoted fans of the game who have played this game for years and have requested for the source code to be made public.

If you are here because you are interested in programming, DO NOT DIRECTLY USE THE SOURCE CODE HERE, instead, start by using any of the following frameworks or languages depending on your target audience:

Cross-Platform: Unity / Godot / Cocos / NativeScript
Native iOS: Swift
Native Android: Kotlin / Java
Web: Typescript / Javascript

On the database side you can start with MariaDB but may have to move to something on top of Hadoop in time.

Build a minimally viable product, and slowly add to it. It may sound tough, but once you have a solid start the momentum will keep you going, and you will learn a lot more.

The primary reasons to start anew are:

- For security reasons (also because of outdated security practices), the actual database connection and user login scripts have not been included. So the code here does not give you a turnkey server.
- A lot of technology used back at the creation of this game have long been deprecated. Even if you spend time to get it working... it may stop working with a future OS/browser update.
- Trends have shifted and there's a growing number of players who play on mobile only.


## I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

This is the game I wrote near the start of my programming career. The code is procedural, unscalable (supports only <5k active players even with a decent server), and you can feel the stench from a mile away. Much of the design was done with copy-and-paste. Since first writing the game, many functions used are now considered deprecated. It is possible that the game may stop working at any point in the future when a new OS/browser update comes out.

The game is currently still available to play at https://capitalism-online.com.
